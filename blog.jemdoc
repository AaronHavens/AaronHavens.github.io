== A necessary stability condition for differentiable autonomous systems.
/Theorem/: \n 
/Consider the autonomous system/ 
\( 
        \dot x = f(x) 
\) 
/in dimension $n\neq 4$ with isolated equilibrium point $x^*$. Then $x^*$ is locally asymptotically stable only if the index of $f$ at $x^*$ is $(-1)^n$, that is/ 
\( 
\text{Ind}_{x^*}(f) = (-1)^n. 
\)
