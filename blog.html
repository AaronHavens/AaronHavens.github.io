<h2>A necessary stability condition for differentiable autonomous systems.</h2>
<p><i>Theorem: Consider the autonomous system</i>
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[ 
        \dot x = f(x) 
\]
</p><p><i>in dimension \(n\neq 4\) with isolated equilibrium point \(x^*\). Then \(x^*\) is locally asymptotically stable only if the index of \(f\) at \(x^*\) is \((-1)^n\), that is</i> 
</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
\[ 
\text{Ind}_{x^*}(f) = (-1)^n. 
\]
</p><p>This can be a useful condition to check for nonlinear systems as opposed to the sufficient Lyapunov test. 
However, the index is preserved under homotopy, which is a rather weak notion of equivalance. There are plenty of linear systems which are homotopic to one another, but have different stability properties. 
The proof that I learned requires \(n\neq 4\) since it is not known if sublevel sets of a smooth Lyapunov function are diffeomorphic to a \(3\) dimensional disk (they are atleast homoemorphic). 
This may seem like a funny intricacy because, due to Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture, Wilson's theorem says that super level sets of smooth Lyapunov functions are diffeomorphic to \(S^{n-1}\) for all dimensions. 
One would think that the interior of such \(n-1\) sphere would look a lot like a disk. This condition can be removed by considering homoemorphism of trajectories and maybe I will take the time to prove this soon.
