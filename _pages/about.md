I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Meta's Fundamental AI Research working on Generative modeling foundations team under Brian Karrer and Yaron Lipman. I'm interested in developing new scalable generative modeling paradigms and principled reward-based tilting methods for both continuous and discrete domains. I'm especially passionate about modeling physical processes that help advance engineering and science, taking into account geometric structures and invariants.

**Previously** I received a PhD in ECE from UIUC researching scalable methods in control theory and machine learning under Prof. Bin Hu. I have an MS in Aerospace engineering where I primarily worked on learning algorithms for field-robotics under Prof. Girish Chowdhary. I've been fortunate to have several industry research experiences at Meta FAIR NYC, Peferred Networks (Tokyo), TuSimple (autonomous semi-trucks) and NASA Jet Propulsion Labs.
